#Danebook!

by [Justin Mullis](https://github.com/nonadmin)
part of [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/)

A Ruby on Rails application built to showcase concepts learned during the Viking Code School.  May resemble a certain very popular social network.  

Development covered everything from basic and advanced Rails, AWS integration for file uploads, email templating, and unobtrusive Javascript forms for posting and commenting.

Deployed on [Heroku](https://fast-inlet-8291.herokuapp.com/)
